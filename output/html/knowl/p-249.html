<p>Finally, for each of these examples, let us determine which sets are open and closed. In each case, the only questions that aren't answered by the axioms are: “is \(\{ x \}\) open? closed?” and “is \(\{ y \}\) open? closed?”</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>in the discrete topology, both \(\{ x \}\) and \(\{ y \}\) are both open and closed;</p></li>
<li><p>in the second topology, \(\{ x \}\) is closed and not open, and \(\{ y \}\) is open and not closed.</p></li>
<li><p>in the third topology, the situation is reversed: \(\{ x \}\) is open and not closed, and \(\{ y \}\) is closed and not open;</p></li>
<li><p>in the last of these topologies, neither \(\{ x \}\) nor \(\{ y \}\) is open or closed.</p></li>
</ul>
