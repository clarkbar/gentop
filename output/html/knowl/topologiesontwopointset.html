<p>Let \(X \coloneq \{ x , y \}\text{.}\) In order to specify a topology \(\tau\) on \(X\text{,}\) it is really only necessary to specify the subsets \(\tau ( \{ x \} )\) and \(\tau ( \{ y \} )\text{.}\) The first condition states that these subsets must contain the sets \(\{ x \}\) and \(\{ y \}\text{,}\) respectively, and the second and third conditions become automatic. That gives us four topologies on \(\{ x, y \}\text{:}\)</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>the discrete topology, in which \(\tau( \{ x \} ) = \{ x \}\) and \(\tau( \{ y \} ) = \{ y \}\text{;}\)</p></li>
<li><p>the topology in which \(\tau( \{ x \} ) = \{ x \}\text{,}\) and \(\tau( \{ y \} ) = X\text{;}\)</p></li>
<li><p>the topology in which \(\tau( \{ y \} ) = X\text{,}\) and \(\tau( \{ x \} ) = \{ x \}\text{;}\) and</p></li>
<li><p>the topology in which \(\tau( \{ x \} ) = \tau( \{ y \} ) = X\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us describe the relation of closeness for each of these topologies. The only questions that aren't answered by the axioms of a topology is: “is \(x\) close to \(\{ y \}\text{?}\)” and “is \(y\) close to \(\{ x \}\text{?}\)” Let's answer these in each case:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>in the discrete topology, \(x\) is not close to \(\{ y \}\text{,}\) and \(y\) is not close to \(\{ x \}\text{;}\)</p></li>
<li><p>in the second of these topologies, \(x\) is close to \(\{ y \}\text{,}\) but \(y\) is not close to \(\{ x \}\text{;}\)</p></li>
<li><p>in the third topology, \(y\) is close to \(\{ x \}\text{,}\) but \(x\) is not close to \(\{ y \}\text{;}\) and</p></li>
<li><p>finally, in the last of these topologies, \(x\) is close to \(\{ y \}\) and \(y\) is close to \(\{ x \}\text{.}\)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The asymmetry in the second and third topologies is strange from our natural idea of what “close” ought to mean. Nevertheless, these topologies are actually interesting examples; even rather bizarre ideas of closeness can be captured in topology!</p>
<p>Finally, for each of these examples, let us determine which sets are open and closed. In each case, the only questions that aren't answered by the axioms are: “is \(\{ x \}\) open? closed?” and “is \(\{ y \}\) open? closed?”</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>in the discrete topology, both \(\{ x \}\) and \(\{ y \}\) are both open and closed;</p></li>
<li><p>in the second topology, \(\{ x \}\) is closed and not open, and \(\{ y \}\) is open and not closed.</p></li>
<li><p>in the third topology, the situation is reversed: \(\{ x \}\) is open and not closed, and \(\{ y \}\) is closed and not open;</p></li>
<li><p>in the last of these topologies, neither \(\{ x \}\) nor \(\{ y \}\) is open or closed.</p></li>
