<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Let us show that the first of these conditions implies the second. Suppose \(A\) compact, and suppose \((x_i)_{i\geq 0}\) a sequence of points in \(A\text{.}\) If there were no convergent subsequence of \((x_i)_{i\geq 0}\text{,}\) then the set \(\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}\) would be a closed subset of \(A\text{,}\) hence compact, and there would be a sequence \(\varepsilon_i\) of positive real numbers such that the balls \(B^n(x_i,\varepsilon_i)\) would be disjoint. But then \(\{B^n(x_i,\varepsilon_i)\}_{i\geq 0}\) would be an open cover of \(\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}\) with no finite subcover.</p>
<p>Let us show that the second property implies the third. Suppose \(A\) has the property that every sequence has a convergent subsequence. Then \(A\) must be bounded, since otherwise there exists a sequence \((x_i)_{i\geq 0}\) of points in \(A\) such that \(\|x_i\|\to\infty\text{.}\) It must also be closed, since if \(x\in\overline{A}-A\text{,}\) one can construct a sequence of points of \(A\) converging to \(x\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Finally, let us show that the third condition implies the first. Suppose \(A\) is closed and bounded. Since \(A\) is bounded, it is contained in a box \([-a,a]^n\) for some \(a\geq 0\text{.}\) Since every closed subspace of a compact space is compact, it is enough to show that \([-a,a]^n\) is compact. Since a finite product of compacta is compact, it is enough to show that any closed interval is compact, and we've already shown this.</p></article></body>
