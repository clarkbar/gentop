<p>Finally, let us show that the third condition implies the first. Suppose \(A\) is closed and bounded. Since \(A\) is bounded, it is contained in a box \([-a,a]^n\) for some \(a\geq 0\text{.}\) Since every closed subspace of a compact space is compact, it is enough to show that \([-a,a]^n\) is compact. Since a finite product of compacta is compact, it is enough to show that any closed interval is compact, and we've already shown this.</p>
