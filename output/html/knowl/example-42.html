<p>Let \(V\) be a finite dimensional real vector space. Since \(V\) is a finite dimensional, it is isomorphic to \(\RR^n\text{.}\) Let us transport the topology from \(\RR^n\) to \(V\) along such an isomorphism.</p>
<aside class="aside aside-like"><p>That is, if \(\phi \colon V \to \RR^n\) is a linear isomorphism, then \(U \subseteq V\) is open if and only if \(\phi(V) \subseteq \RR^n\) is open. As an exercise, you can show that the topology is the same, irrespective of which isomorphism \(\phi\) you select. (Hint: linear isomorphisms from \(\RR^n\) to itself are always homeomorphisms!)</p></aside><p>Thus \(V\) is homeomorphic to \(\RR^n\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For every \(k \in \NN^{\ast}\text{,}\) the set \(V^k\) of \(k\)-tuples \((v_1, \dots,
v_k)\) of vectors in \(V\) is also a vector space, and thus also a topological space that is homeomorphic to \(\RR^{nk}\text{.}\) Now we let \(L_{\RR}(k,V) \subseteq V^k\) be the set of \(k\)-tuples \((v_1, \dots,
v_k)\) of vectors in \(V\) that are linearly independent, so that they span a \(k\)-dimensional subspace of \(V\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now we define an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(L_{\RR}(k, V)\) by the rule that \((v_1, \dots,
v_k) \sim (w_1, \dots, w_k)\) if and only if their spans are equal (as subspaces of \(V\)). The quotient space \(G_{\RR}(k,V) \coloneq L_{\RR}(k,V)/\!\sim\) is called the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Grassmannian</dfn> of \(k\)-dimensional subspaces of \(V\text{.}\) The points of \(G_{\RR}(k,V)\) are \(k\)-dimensional real linear subspaces of \(V\text{.}\) One often writes \(G_{\RR}(k,n)\) as a shorthand for \(G_{\RR}(k, \RR^n)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>In the particular case in which \(k=1\text{,}\) the space \(G_{\RR}(1,n)\) is the space of lines through the origin of \(\RR^n\text{;}\) this is also called the (real) <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">projective space</dfn> \(\PP^{n-1}_{\RR}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We can do this same thing with \(\CC\) in place</p>
<aside class="aside aside-like"><p>That is, we can look at a finite dimensional complex vector space V with the topology transported from \(\CC^n \cong \RR^{2n}\text{;}\) we can consider the subspace \(L(k, V)\) of \(\CC\)-linearly independent \(k\)-tuples of \(V^k\text{;}\) and we can contemplate the quotient \(G(k, V)\) of \(k\)-dimensional complex subspaces of \(V\text{.}\)</p></aside><p>of \(\RR\text{.}\)</p>
<p>In particular, \(G(k,n)\) is the space of <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">complex</em> lines through the origin in \(\CC^n\text{;}\) this is called the (complex) <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">projective space</dfn> \(\PP^{n-1}\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_quotient_spaces.html#example-42">in-context</a></span>
