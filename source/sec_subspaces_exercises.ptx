  <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>X \subseteq \RR^m</m> be a subspace.
	The formation of the <term>closure</term> is an operation
	<me>
		\tau \colon \PP(X) \to \PP(X)
	</me>
	on the power set <m>\PP(X)</m>
	(i.e., a map from <m>\PP(X)</m> to itself).
	The formation of the <term>complement</term> is an operation
	<me>
		\kappa \colon \PP(X) \to \PP(X) \period
	</me>
	Thus <m>\kappa(S) = X \smallsetminus S</m>.

	Please note that <m>\tau</m> is <term>inclusion-preserving</term> <mdash />
	that is, if <m>S \subseteq T</m>, then <m>\tau(S) \subseteq \tau(T)</m>. <mdash />
	and <m>\kappa</m> is <term>inclusion-reversing</term> <mdash />
	that is, if <m>S \subseteq T</m>, then <m>\kappa(S) \supseteq \kappa(T)</m>.
	Also of course <m>S\subseteq \tau(S)</m>.
	Finally, please observe that <m>\tau</m> is <term>idempotent</term> <mdash />
	that is, <m>\tau^2 = \tau</m>
	and that <m>\kappa</m> is <term>involutive</term> <mdash />
	that is, <m>\kappa^2 = \operatorname{id}</m>.

	We are interested in the operations <m>\PP(X) \to \PP(X)</m> that we can obtain by composing <m>\tau</m> and <m>\kappa</m> repeatedly.
	For example, the <term>interior</term> operator is
	<me>
		\iota \coloneq \kappa\tau\kappa \colon \PP(X) \to \PP(X).
	</me>
	Note that <m>\iota</m> is inclusion-preserving,
	and <m>\iota</m> is idempotent.

	Many of the most important kinds of subsets of topological spaces are identified using <m>\tau</m> and <m>\kappa</m>.
	For example, a subset <m>S\subseteq X</m> is <term>closed</term> if and only if it is its own closure: <m>S=\tau(S)=S</m>;
	it is <term>open</term> if and only if it is its own interior: <m>S=\iota(S)=\kappa\tau\kappa(S)</m>.

	Write down all the subsets of <m>\RR</m> you can obtain by repeatedly applying the closure <m>\tau</m> and the interior <m>\iota</m> to the set

	A subset <m>S \subseteq X</m> is said to be <term>co-dense</term> if it has empty interior, so that <m>\iota(S) = \varnothing</m>.

	A subset <m>S \subseteq X</m> is said to be <term>nowhere dense</term> if the interior of its closure is empty;
	that is, <m>S</m> is nowhere dense if <m>\iota\tau(S)=\varnothing</m>, or equivalently, <m>\kappa\tau\kappa\tau(S) = \varnothing</m>.
	Any nowhere dense subset of a topological space is co-dense, but
	give an example of a co-dense subset of <m>\RR</m> that is not nowhere dense.
