    We also want to be able to carve out pieces of our sets defined by suitable formulas.
    So if <m>X</m> is a set, and <m>\phi(x)</m> is some formula of set theory
    (any sentence of predicate calculus along with <m>\in</m> in which the only free variable is <m>x</m>),
    then the axioms of set theory allow us to form a set
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      This bit of notation is sometimes called
      <term>set-builder</term> notation.
      The axioms say,
      in effect, that this notation actually means something,
      as long as the <m>X</m> that appears on the left side of the colon is known to be a set.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <me>
    A = \left\{x\in X : \phi(x)\right\}
  </me>.
  <p>
    Thus <m>A</m> is the set whose elements are all and only those elements <m>x\in X</m> such that <m>\phi(x)</m> obtains.

        It's important that sets defined by formulas are carved out of existing sets.
        This is called <term>bounded comprehension</term>.
        With an <em>unbounded</em> comprehension axiom,
        we would be able to build the following:
        <me>
          R\coloneq\left\{X : \neg(X\in X)\right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have seen this: this <m>R</m> creates some challenges,
        since <m>R \in R</m> if and only if <m>R \notin R</m>.
        This is the example that Bertrand Russell cooked up,
        just to ruin Gottlob Frege's day.
