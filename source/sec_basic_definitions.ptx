  <title>Basic definitions</title>
  <p>
    Our starting place is the study of the
    <em>subspaces</em> of Euclidean space.
  </p>
  <video youtube="xfRdYLPWcsI"></video>
  <notation>
    <p>
      As usual, <m>\RR</m> will denote the ordered field of real numbers.
      For any <m>n\geq 0</m>,
      we write <m>\RR^n</m> for the vector space of <m>n</m>-tuples
      <m>x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)</m> with <m>x_i \in \RR</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our purposes,
      one of the most important features <m>\RR^n</m> has to offer is its
      <term>metric</term>; this is the map
      <me>
        d \colon \RR^n \times \RR^n \to \RR
      </me>,
      called the <term>distance</term>, given by the formula
      <me>
        d(x,y) \coloneq \|x - y\| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This map enjoys four key properties:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            (Nonnegativity.) For every pair of points <m>x,y \in \RR^n</m>,
            one has <m>d(x,y) \geq 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (Identity.) For every pair of points <m>x,y \in \RR^n</m>,
            one has <m>d(x,y)=0</m> if and only if <m>x=y</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (Symmetry.) For every pair of points <m>x,y \in \RR^n</m>,
            one has <m>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (Triangle inequality.) For every triple of points <m>x,y,z \in \RR^n</m>, one has
            <me>
              d(x,y) + d(y,z) \geq d(x, z)
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>r \geq 0</m> and <m>x \in \RR^n</m>,
      then we define the <term>ball of radius <m>r</m> centered at <m>x</m></term>:
      <me>
        B^n(x,r) \coloneq \{ y \in \RR^n : d(x,y) \lt r \}
      </me>.
    </p>
  </notation>
  <p>
    In topology,
    we are not interested in the metric <m>d</m> itself but in what it can tell us about the nearness of points and subsets:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S \subseteq \RR^n</m> be a subset.
        A point <m>x \in \RR^n</m> will be said to be
        <term>close to</term> <m>S</m> if and only if,
        for every <m>\varepsilon > 0</m>,
        there exists an element <m>s \in S</m> such that <m>d(x,s) \lt \varepsilon</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may express this notion with the aid of an auxiliary quantity.
        Define the <term>distance from <m>x</m> to <m>S</m></term> as
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          If <m>S = \varnothing</m>, then this infimum doesn't exist as a real number.
          So we'll declare formally that <m>d(x,\varnothing) = +\infty</m>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <me>
        d(x,S) \coloneq \inf \{ d(x,s) : s \in S \}
      </me>.
      <p>
        Then <m>x</m> is <term>close to</term>
        <m>S</m> if and only if <m>d(x,S) =0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m> be a subset such that <m>S \subseteq X</m>.
        We shall write <m>\tau_X(S) \subseteq X</m> for the set of <m>x \in X</m> that are close to <m>S</m>:
        <me>
          \tau_X(S) \coloneq \{ x \in X : (\forall \varepsilon >0)(\exists s \in S)(d(x,s)\lt \varepsilon) \} = \{x \in X : d(x,S) = 0\}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called the <term>closure of <m>S</m> in <m>X</m></term>.
        In other words,
        <me>
          \tau_X(S) = X \cap \bigcap_{\varepsilon>0}\bigcup_{s\in S} B^n(s,\varepsilon)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will refer to <m>X</m> along with the map
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          The set <m>\PP(X)</m> is the <em>powerset</em> of <m>X</m>;
          it is the set of subsets of <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        <m>\tau_X \colon \PP(X) \to \PP(X)</m> as the <term>subspace</term>
        <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Every time you see a new definition in mathematics,
    you should begin immediately to think about as many examples as you can.
    You should also have a couple of
    <term>counterexamples</term> at hand,
    preferably at least one for each condition in a definition.
    Then, when you encounter a theorem with a proof,
    you can take your example and
    <q>run</q>
    the proof on your example,
    and you can run it on your counterexample to see where the conditions are really being used.
    This is one of the most important ways to understand how theorems really work.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that spirit, let's dig into some examples.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>X = \varnothing</m>, then this definition becomes a little boring:
            the only subset of <m>\varnothing</m> is <m>\varnothing</m> itself,
            and <m>\tau_{\varnothing}(\varnothing) = \varnothing</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>X = \RR</m> itself,
            then let's see what happens for various choices of <m>S</m>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Let's consider various unit intervals:
                  <me>
                    \tau_{\RR}(\left]0,1\right[) = \tau_{\RR}([0,1]) = \tau_{\RR}(\left]0,1\right]) = [0,1]
                  </me>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>\QQ \subset \RR</m> denotes the set of rational numbers,
                  then <m>\tau_{\RR}(\QQ) = \RR</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  At the same time, <m>\tau_{\RR}(\RR \smallsetminus \QQ) = \RR</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Confirm that <m>\tau_{\RR}(\varnothing)=\varnothing</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m> is a subspace, then we have
            <me>
              \tau_X(S) = \tau_{\RR^n}(S) \cap X
            </me>.
            This is an important point:
            the closure of <m>S</m> is done
            <em>relative to the subspace <m>X</m></em>.
            Let's see how the closure of
            <m>S = \left]0,1\right[</m> depends on which subspace
            <m>X \subseteq \RR</m> in which we are closing:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>X=\RR</m>, then <m>\tau_{\RR}(\left]0,1\right[) = [0,1]</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>X=\left]0,1\right[</m>,
                  then <m>\tau_{\left]0,1\right[}(\left]0,1\right[) = \left]0,1\right[</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>X=\left]0,1\right]</m>,
                  then <m>\tau_{\left]0,1\right]}(\left]0,1\right[) = \left]0,1\right]</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>X=\left]0,+\infty\right[</m>,
                  then <m>\tau_{\left]0,+\infty\right[}(\left]0,1\right[) = \left]0,1\right]</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>

    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X \subseteq \RR</m> be a subspace.
        Let <m>S \subseteq X</m> be a nonempty subset that is bounded above.
        The completeness property of <m>\RR</m> then ensures that <m>S</m> has a supremum <m>\sup S</m>.
        If <m>\sup S \in X</m>,
        then <m>\sup S</m> is close to <m>S</m> in <m>X</m>; that is,
        <me>
          \sup S \in \tau_X(S)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's prove this; let <m>x\coloneq \sup S</m>.
        Let <m>\varepsilon>0</m>.
        If <m>\left]x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon\right[ \cap S = \varnothing</m>,
        then <m>x-\varepsilon</m> is also an upper bound for <m>S</m>,
        contradicting the assumption that <m>x</m> is the <em>least</em>
        upper bound for <m>S</m>.
        Consequently,
        there exists an element <m>s \in S</m> such that <m>d(x,s) \lt \varepsilon</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same argument shows that if
        <m>S \subseteq X</m> is nonempty and bounded below,
        then if <m>\inf S \in X</m>, then
        <me>
          \inf S \in \tau_X(S)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Here are the basic facts about the closure operator <m>\tau_X \colon \PP(X) \to \PP(X)</m>.
    As we shall see,
    these facts are in many ways even more important than the definition of <m>\tau_X</m> itself.

    <p>
      Suppose that <m>U \subseteq X</m> is open,
      and let <m>x \in U</m> be a point.
      Then by definition,
      <m>x</m> is not close to <m>X \smallsetminus U</m>.
      Hence there exists <m>\varepsilon>0</m> such that for any point <m>y \in X \smallsetminus U</m>,

      For some <m>\varepsilon>0</m>,
      the intersection <m>B^n(x,\varepsilon) \cap X</m> is contained in <m>U</m>.

      the intersection <m>B^n(x, \varepsilon) \cap (X \smallsetminus U) \neq \varnothing</m>.
      This is a contradiction that shows that no point of <m>U</m> is close to <m>X \smallsetminus U</m>;

  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>Z' \subseteq \RR^n</m> is a closed subset.
      Now consider the intersection <m>Z' \cap X</m>.
      The closure <m>\tau_{\RR^n}(Z' \cap X)</m> is contained in <m>\tau_{\RR^n}(Z') = Z'</m>.
      Consequently,

      its complement in <m>X</m>, which is <m>U' \cap X</m> is open.
      Conversely, if <m>U \subseteq X</m> is open,
      then let <m>Z</m> denote its complement in <m>X</m>.
      By what we've already shown,
      there is a closed subset <m>Z' \subseteq \RR^n</m> such that <m>Z = Z' \cap X</m>,
