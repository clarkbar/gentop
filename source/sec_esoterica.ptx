    The universe of topological spaces is very large,
    and it includes some <term>beasts</term>.
    These beasts exhibit some very strange behavior,
    at least from the standpoint of the topological spaces we construct from Euclidean spaces and finite sets.
    These are sometimes called <term>pathological topological spaces</term>
    or just <term>pathologies</term>.
    They are useful as counterexamples to certain implications in the world of topology,
    but their importance should not be overestimated.
