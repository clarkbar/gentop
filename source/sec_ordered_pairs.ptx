  <title>Ordered pairs</title>
  <p>
    We can also create <term>ordered pairs</term>.
    For sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, we write
    <me>
      \angs{X,Y}\coloneq\left\{\{X\},\{X,Y\}\right\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now for any two sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>,
    we define the <term>product</term>
    as the set of all ordered pairs:
    <me>
      X\times Y\coloneq\left\{S\in\PP(\PP(X\cup Y)) : (\exists x\in X)(\exists y\in Y)(\angs{x,y}=S)\right\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also define an <term>ordered triple</term> by the rule
    <me>
      \angs{X,Y,Z}\coloneq\angs{\angs{X,Y},Z}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can keep going with this to build ordered quadruples and ordered quintuples,
    <em>etc.</em>,
    but once we have the concept of map up and running,
    we'll find more efficient and intuitive ways to talk about these things.

  <p>
    \begin{exr} How many elements does the ordered pair <m>\angs{x,x}</m> have?
    How about the ordered triple <m>\angs{x,x,x}</m>? \end{exr}
