    There are three observations we can make about our study of subspaces of Euclidean space:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          When we think about the topological nature of a subspace <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m>,
          the ambient Euclidean space in which we find them isn't all that important;
          homeomorphic subspaces can be found in wildly different Euclidean spaces.
          The only thing we <em>do</em> want to remember from the ambient <m>\RR^n</m> is the definition of the closure operator <m>\tau_X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For the vast majority of the work we've done so far,
          we didn't need the precise definition of <m>\tau_X</m> in terms of the metric on <m>\RR^n</m>.
          Rather, what we really used repeatedly were the properties given in <xref ref="prp_key_properties_of_tau" autoname="yes"/>.
          Almost everything we did was just a direct consequence of those!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There are examples of sets with a reasonable notion of closeness that don't arrive in your lap embedded in a Euclidean space.
          We want to <em>do topology</em> with these examples too!

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's illustrate this last point with an interesting example.
        Let <m>\PP^1_{\RR}</m> be the set of <m>1</m>-dimensional linear subspaces of <m>\RR^2</m>.
        In other words, an element of
        <m>\PP^1_{\RR}</m> is a line in <m>\RR^2</m> through the origin.
        If <m>L \in \PP^1_{\RR}</m>, let <m>\mu(L)</m> denote the slope of <m>L</m>;
        that is, if <m>L</m> is spanned by a nonzero vector <m>(x,y) \in \RR^2</m>, then
        <me>
          \mu(L) = \begin{cases}y/x \amp  \text{ if } x \neq 0\text{;} \\ \infty \amp  \text{ if } x=0 . \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will say that a line <m>L \in \PP^1_{\RR}</m> is close to a subset
        <m>S \subseteq \PP^1_{\RR}</m> if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              if <m>\mu(L) \neq \infty</m>,
              then for every <m>\varepsilon>0</m>,
              there exists a line <m>L' \in S</m>, such that
              <me>
                |\mu(L) - \mu(L')| \lt  \varepsilon
              </me>,
              or
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              if <m>\mu(L) = \infty</m>,
              then for every real number <m>N</m>,
              there exists a line <m>L' \in S</m> such that
              <me>
                |\mu(L')|>N
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Equivalently,
        if we think of the circle <m>S^1 \subset \RR^2</m>,
        then every line <m>L \in \PP^1_{\RR}</m> intersects <m>S^1</m> in exactly two points
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          For our purposes,
          it won't matter which of the two intersection points we call <m>i(L)</m> and which we call <m>j(L)</m>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        <m>i(L)</m> and <m>j(L)</m>, where <m>i(L) = -j(L)</m>.
        We may now say that <m>L \in \PP^1_{\RR}</m> is close to <m>S \subseteq \PP^1_{\RR}</m> if and only if,
        for every <m>\varepsilon>0</m>,
        there exists a line <m>L' \in S</m> such that either
        <m>\|i(L)-i(L')\|\lt \varepsilon</m> or <m>\|i(L)-j(L)\|\lt \varepsilon</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    To deal with examples like this one,
    we're going to pull a trick that is often quite powerful in mathematics:
    we're going to turn <xref ref="prp_key_properties_of_tau" autoname="yes"/> into a <em>definition</em>.
    Thus a <term>topology</term> on a set <m>X</m> is a systematic way of asking whether an element of <m>X</m> <mdash/> which we will call
    <em>point</em> <mdash/> is
    <q>close</q>
    to a subset.
    In order to constitute a topology on the set <m>X</m>,
    this notion of closeness must satsify three conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every subset <m>S \subseteq X</m> and any point <m>x \in X</m>,
          if <m>x \in S</m>, then <m>x</m> is close to <m>S</m>.
          More briefly, an element of a subset is close to that subset.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every finite collection
          <m>\{ S_1, \dots, S_n \}</m> of subsets of <m>X</m>,
          if a point <m>x \in X</m> is close to the union <m>S_1 \cup \dots \cup S_n</m>,
          then there exists <m>i \in \{ 1, \dots,
          n \}</m> such that <m>x</m> is close to <m>S_i</m>.
          More briefly, if a point is close to a finite union of subsets,
          then it is close to one of those subsets.
          In particular, when <m>n = 0</m>,
          this condition says that no point is close to the empty set <m>\emptyset</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are two subsets of <m>X</m> such that every point <m>s \in S</m> is close to <m>T</m>;
          then if a point <m>x</m> is close to <m>S</m>,
          it is also close to <m>T</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    To formalise this idea, we introduce,
    for each subset <m>S \subseteq X</m>,
    the set <m>\tau(S)</m> of all the elements of <m>X</m> that are close to <m>S</m>,
    and we list its properties.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>topology</term> on a set <m>X</m> is a map

              <me>
                \tau \left( \bigcup_{ S \in \Sigma} S \right) = \bigcup_{ S \in \Sigma } \tau(S)
              </me>.

              </aside>
              <m>\tau (\emptyset) = \emptyset</m>.
              Also, observe that <m>\tau</m> is
              <term>inclusion-preserving</term>;
              that is, if <m>S \subseteq T</m>,
              then <m>\tau(S) \subseteq \tau(T)</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              For any <m>S \in \PP(X)</m>, one has <m>\tau( \tau( S ) ) = \tau( S )</m>.

        A pair <m>(X, \tau)</m> consisting of a set <m>X</m> and a topology <m>\tau</m> on <m>X</m> is called a

        We call the elements of a topological space <term>points</term>.

      <p>
        The set <m>\tau(S)</m> is called the

        We say that <m>S</m> is <term>closed</term> if <m>S = \tau( S )</m>,

        if its complement is closed.

          In a little while,

      We will often write just <m>X</m> for the topological space,

        We have already seen the first example.
        Any subset <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m> inherits a topology <m>\tau_X</m> that carries a subset <m>S \subseteq X</m> to
        <me>
          \tau_X(S) = \{ x\in X : (\forall \varepsilon>0)(\exists s \in S)(d(x,s)\lt \varepsilon\}

      <p>
        When <m>X=\RR^n</m>, this is often called the

        The power set <m>\PP( \{ x \} )</m> is a two-element set <m>\{ \emptyset, \{ x \} \}</m>.
        There are four maps from this set to itself,
        but most of these are not topologies.
        In order for a map <m>\tau</m> to be a topology,
        the first condition demands that <m>\tau( \{ x \} ) = \{ x \}</m>,
        and the second condition demands that <m>\tau ( \emptyset ) = \emptyset</m>.
        Thus the only topology on the singleton <m>\{ x \}</m> is the discrete topology.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              finally, in the last of these topologies,
              <m>x</m> is close to <m>\{ y \}</m> and <m>y</m> is close to <m>\{ x \}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The asymmetry in the second and third topologies is strange from our natural idea of what
        <q>close</q>
        ought to mean.
        Nevertheless,
        these topologies are actually interesting examples;
        even rather bizarre ideas of closeness can be captured in topology!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, for each of these examples,
        let us determine which sets are open and closed.
        In each case,
        the only questions that aren't answered by the axioms are:
        <q>is <m>\{ x \}</m> open? closed?</q>
        and
        <q>is <m>\{ y \}</m> open? closed?</q>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              in the discrete topology,
              both <m>\{ x \}</m> and <m>\{ y \}</m> are both open and closed;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              in the second topology, <m>\{ x \}</m> is closed and not open,
              and <m>\{ y \}</m> is open and not closed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              in the third topology, the situation is reversed:
              <m>\{ x \}</m> is open and not closed,
              and <m>\{ y \}</m> is closed and not open;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              in the last of these topologies,
              neither <m>\{ x \}</m> nor <m>\{ y \}</m> is open or closed.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The discrete topology makes sense for any set.
    Similarly, the last of the topologies in <xref ref="topologiesontwopointset" autoname="yes"/> above is sensible for any set.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any set <m>X</m>, we define a map
        <me>
          \iota \colon \PP(X) \to \PP(X)
        </me>
        by the formula
        <me>
          \iota( S ) \coloneq \begin{cases}\emptyset \amp  \text{ if }  S = \emptyset ; \\ X \amp  \text{ if }  S \neq \emptyset . \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a topology called the <term>indiscrete topology</term>.
        Thus in the indiscrete topology,
        any point is close to any nonempty subset.
        The only subsets of <m>X</m> that are open or closed in the indiscrete topology are <m>\emptyset</m> and <m>X</m> itself.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The other two topologies of <xref ref="topologiesontwopointset" autoname="yes"/> are more interesting:
  </p>
  <example xml:id="exm_Alexandroff">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>P</m> be a <em>preorder</em>.
        That is, <m>P</m> is a set equipped with a relation <m>\leq</m> such that:

          <li>
            <p>
              for every <m>a \in P</m>, one has <m>a \leq a</m>; and

        Form the set <m>\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>,
        where <m>\infty</m> is just some symbol such that <m>\infty\notin\RR</m>.
        We already have a topology on <m>\RR</m>;
        let's doctor it a mite to make a topology on <m>\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>.
        To do this, we have to understand how our notion of closeness has changed.
        So we have a point <m>x\in \RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m> and a subset <m>S\subseteq\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>,
        and we want to see if <m>x</m> is close to <m>S</m>.

            <p>
              If <m>x\in\RR</m>,

        Let's see that this is a topology.
        In effect, you check everything by checking the two cases (<m>x\in\RR</m> or <m>x\notin\RR</m>) separately.
        In the first case,
        you use the fact that <m>\RR</m> has a topology already,
        and in the second, you give a little argument.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              By definition if <m>x</m> lies in a subset <m>S\subseteq\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>,
              then <m>x</m> is close to <m>S</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>\{S_1,\dots,S_n\}</m> be a finite collection of subsets of <m>\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>.
              If <m>x\in \RR</m>, then since one has
              <me>
                (S_1\cup\dots\cup S_n)\cap\RR=(S_1\cap\RR)\cup\dots\cup (S_n\cap\RR)
              </me>,
              it follows that <m>x</m> is close to
              <m>S_1\cup\dots\cup S_n</m> if and only if <m>x</m> is close to <m>(S_1\cap\RR)\cup\dots\cup (S_n\cap\RR)</m>
              (for the standard topology on <m>\RR</m>),
              if and only if <m>x</m> is close to <m>S_i \cap \RR</m> for some <m>i</m>
              (for the topology on <m>\RR</m>),
              if and only if <m>x</m> is close to <m>S_i</m>.
              Now <m>\infty</m> is close to
              <m>S_1\cup\dots\cup S_n</m> if and only if, for any <m>N\in\RR</m>,
              there is a point of <m>S_1\cup\dots\cup S_n</m> that does not lie in <m>[-N,N]</m>.
              This happens if and only if there is an <m>i</m> such that for any <m>N\in\RR</m>, there is

                  This is the <term>pigeonhole principle</term>.
                  In effect, if <m>X</m> is an infinite set,
                  <m>Y</m> is a finite set, and <m>f\colon\fromto{X}{Y}</m> is a map,
                  there is an element <m>y\in Y</m> such that <m>f^{-1}\{y\}</m> is infinite.

          <li>
            <p>
              Finally, suppose that every point of a subset
              <m>S\subseteq\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m> is close to a subset <m>T\subseteq\RR\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>.
              Now if <m>x</m> is close to <m>S</m>, there are two options.
              First, if <m>x\in\RR</m>,
              then <m>x</m> is close to <m>S\cap\RR</m> and hence to <m>T\cap\RR</m>.
              Otherwise, if <m>x=\infty</m>,
              then if <m>\infty\in T</m> or <m>\infty\in S</m>, then we're done.
              If not, then for every <m>N\in\RR</m>,
              there is a point <m>s_N\in S\subseteq\RR</m> such that <m>|s_N|>N</m>;
              this point <m>s_N</m> is close to <m>T</m>,
              so if we set <m>\epsilon_N\coloneq|s_N|-N</m>,
              then there exists a point <m>t_N\in T</m> such that <m>|s_N-t_N|\lt \epsilon_N</m>.
              Thus <m>|t_N|>N</m>, and so <m>\infty</m> is close to <m>T</m>.

    To see that <m>\mathscr{C}_{\tau}</m> is stable under intersection and finite union,
    let <m>\Sigma \subseteq \mathscr{C}_{\tau}</m> be a subset.
    Let <m>W</m> be the intersection <m>\bigcap_{Z \in \Sigma} Z</m>.
    For every <m>Z \in \Sigma</m>,
    since <m>\tau</m> is inclusion-preserving,
    it follows that <m>\tau\left(W\right) \subseteq \tau(Z) = Z</m>.
    Consequently,
    <m>\tau(W)</m> is contained in the intersection <m>W</m>,
    so <m>W</m> is closed.
    If <m>\Sigma</m> is finite,
    then since <m>\tau</m> preserves finite unions, we have
    <me>
      \tau\left(\bigcup_{Z\in\Sigma} Z\right) = \bigcup_{Z\in\Sigma} \tau(Z) = \bigcup_{Z \in \Sigma} Z
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This proves that <m>\mathscr{C}_{\tau}</m> is a system of closed sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the opposite direction,
    for any system of closed subsets <m>\mathscr{C}</m> on <m>X</m>,
    define a map <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}\colon\PP(X) \to \PP(X)</m> that carries a subset
    <m>S\subseteq X</m> to the smallest element of
    <m>\mathscr{C}</m> that contains <m>S</m>:
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Since <m>\mathscr{C}</m> is stable under intersections,
      this formula indeed defines an element of <m>\mathscr{C}</m>.
      So <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S)</m> is the smallest element of
      <m>\mathscr{C}</m> that contains <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <me>
    \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S) \coloneq \bigcap_{\substack{Z\in \mathscr{C},\\ S\subseteq Z} } Z
  </me>.
  <p>
    Let us see that <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}</m> is a topology.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          By definition, for every subset <m>S \subseteq X</m>,
          we have <m>S \subseteq \tau(S)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          By definition,
          <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}</m> is an inclusion-preserving operation.
          Thus if <m>S_1, \dots, S_n \subseteq X</m> is a finite collection of subsets of <m>X</m>,
          then it follows that
          <me>
            \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_n) \supseteq \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1) \cup \cdots \cup \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_n)
          </me>.
          On the other hand,
          since <m>\mathscr{C}</m> is stable under finite unions,
          it follows that <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1) \cup \cdots \cup \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_n) \in \mathscr{C}</m>.
          Since in addition,
          <m>S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_n \subseteq \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1) \cup \cdots \cup \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_n)</m>,
          it follows
          <aside>
            <p>
              The point here is that <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_n)</m> is the <em>smallest</em>
              closed subset that contains <m>S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_n</m>.
            </p>
          </aside>
          that
          <me>
            \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1 \cup \cdots \cup S_n) \subseteq \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_1) \cup \cdots \cup \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S_n)
          </me>,
          whence <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}</m> preserves finite unions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally, <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S)</m> is the smallest element of
          <m>\mathscr{C}</m> that contains <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S)</m>.
          But since <m>\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S)</m> itself likes in <m>\mathscr{C}</m>,
          it follows that
          <me>
            \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(\tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S)) \subseteq \tau_{\mathscr{C}}(S)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus one may specify a topology on <m>X</m> by specifying the closed sets and checking stability under intersections and finite unions,
    or specifying the open sets and checking stability under unions and finite intersections.

      Most textbooks define topologies as a system of open sets.
      There's nothing wrong with this definition,
      but we've delayed this description,
      because it seems difficult to motivate fully.

        Here's an extremely important example in modern mathematics.
        This one will be following us around throughout this text.
        Let <m>X \subseteq \RR^m</m> be any subspace, and let <m>n \in \NN</m>.
        We are about to define a topological space <m>C_n(X)</m> called the
        <term>configuration space of <m>n</m> points in <m>X</m></term>.
        As a set, <m>C_n(X)</m> is the set of subsets
        <m>\{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \subseteq X</m> of <m>n</m> distinct points:
        <me>
          C_n(X) \coloneq \{ S \subseteq \PP(X) : \# S = n \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To endow it with a topology, we need to define an auxiliary topological space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall that we defined the subspace
        <me>
          X^n \coloneq X \times \cdots \times X = \{ x = (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \RR^{mn} : (\forall i)(x_i \in X) \} \subseteq \RR^{mn}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now pass to a further subspace:
        <me>
          E_n(X) \coloneq \{(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in X^n : (\forall i,j)((i \neq j) \implies (x_i \neq x_j)) \} \subseteq X^m
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there is a map <m>q \colon  E_m(X) \to C_m(X)</m> defined by
        <me>
          q(x_1, \dots, x_n) \coloneq \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now declare that <m>U \subseteq C_n(X)</m> is open if and only if <m>q^{-1}(U) \subseteq E_n(X)</m> is open.
        This defines a system of open sets
        (and hence a topology),
        since the formation of the inverse image preserves unions and intersections.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

      <p>
        Any set <m>X</m> can be given the
        <term>cofinite</term> topology,
        in which a subset <m>Z\subseteq X</m> is declared to be closed if and only if either <m>Z</m> is finite or <m>Z=X</m>.
        Thus in the cofinite topology,
        <me>
          \tau(S) = \begin{cases}S \amp  \text{ if }  S \text{ is finite; }  \\ X \amp  \text{ if }  S \text{ is infinite. } \end{cases}
        </me>
      </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space, and let <m>x \in X</m>.
        Then an <term>open neighborhood</term>
        of <m>x</m> is an open subset
        <m>U \subseteq X</m> such that <m>x \in U</m>.
        A <term>neighborhood</term> of <m>x</m> is a subset of <m>X</m> that contains an open neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If <m>X</m> is a topological space,
    then <m>\tau(S)</m> is the smallest closed subset that contains <m>S</m>.
    Equivalently,
    a point <m>y \in X</m> lies in the closure <m>\tau(S)</m> if and only if,
    for any open neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>y</m>,
    the intersection <m>U \cap \tau(S)</m> is nonempty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why are these equivalent?
    Well, if <m>y \notin \tau(S)</m>,
    then <m>X \smallsetminus \tau(S)</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>y</m> that does not intersect <m>S</m>.
    Conversely, if <m>U</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m> that does not intersect <m>\tau(S)</m>,
    then <m>X \smallsetminus U</m> is a closed subset that contains <m>S</m> and therefore <m>\tau(S)</m>.
