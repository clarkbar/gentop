    The definition of a <term>product of sets</term>
    is engineered precisely so that a map into the product is determined by each of its components.
    More precisely,
    for any indexed family of sets <m>\{X_a\}_{a\in A}</m>,
    the product
    <me>
      \prod_{a\in A}X_a
    </me>
    is a set equipped with projection maps
    <me>
      \pi_b\colon\fromto{\prod_{a\in A}X_a}{X_b}
    </me>,
    one for every <m>b\in A</m>,
    which together <em>determine</em>
    the maps into <m>\prod_{a\in A}X_a</m>.
    That is, composition with the projections induce a bijection
    <me>
      \prod_{a\in A}\pi_{a}\circ -\colon\fromto{\Map\left(Y,\prod_{a\in A}X_a\right)}{\prod_{a\in A}\Map(Y,X_a)}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the sets <m>X_a</m> are all endowed with topologies,
    then we would like to topologise the product
    <m>\prod_{a\in A}X_a</m> so that the same thing will happen with
    <em>continuous</em> maps.
    That is, we would like to ensure that a map
    <m>f\colon\fromto{Y}{\prod_{a\in A}X_a}</m> is continuous if and only if,
    for every <m>a\in A</m>,
    the composite map <m>\pi_a\circ f\colon\fromto{Y}{X_a}</m> is continuous.
    But we know just how to arrange that:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\{(X_a,\tau_a)\}_{a\in A}</m> be a family of topological spaces.
        Then the <term>product topology</term>
        <m>\prod_{a\in A}\tau_a</m> on
        <m>\prod_{a\in A}X_a</m> is the initial topology with respect to the set <m>\{\pi_a\}_{\alpha\in A}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The definition of the <term>product topology</term>
    is engineered precisely so that a continuous map into the product is determined by each of its continuous components.
    More precisely,
    for any indexed family of topological spaces <m>\{X_a\}_{a\in A}</m>,
    the product
    <me>
      \prod_{a\in A}X_a
    </me>
    is a set equipped with continuous projection maps
    <me>
      \pi_b\colon\fromto{\prod_{a\in A}X_a}{X_b}
    </me>,
    one for every <m>b\in A</m>,
    which together <em>determine</em>
    the maps into <m>\prod_{a\in A}X_a</m>.
    That is, composition with the projections induce a bijection
    <me>
      \prod_{a\in A}\pi_{a}\circ -\colon\fromto{\Map\left(Y,\prod_{a\in A}X_a\right)}{\prod_{a\in A}\Map(Y,X_a)}
    </me>,
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In particular,
        for any set <m>A</m> and any topological space <m>X</m>,
        we may contemplate the product topology on the set <m>\Map(A,X)</m>.
        We write in particular
        <me>
          X^n\coloneq\Map(\{1,\dots,n\},X)\ \ \text{ and } X^{\omega}\coloneq\Map(\NN,X)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For any <m>n\geq 0</m>,
        the product topology on <m>\RR^n</m> coincides with the standard topology
        (from the Euclidean metric).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The product topology on <m>\RR^n</m> is generated by sets of the form <m>\RR\times\cdots\times \left]a,b\right[\times\RR\times\cdots\times\RR</m>.
      Consequently, the sets of the form
      <m>C(x,\varepsilon) \coloneq \prod_{i=1}^n\left]x_i-\varepsilon,x_i+\varepsilon\right[</m> are a base for the product topology.
      Now for any <m>x \in \RR^n</m>,
      and for any <m>\varepsilon>0</m>,
      the exists a <m>\delta>0</m> such that
      <me>
        B(x,\delta) \subseteq C(x,\varepsilon)
      </me>,
      and
      <me>
        C(x,\delta) \subseteq B(x,\varepsilon)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the subsets <m>C(x, \varepsilon)</m> generate the product topology,
      and the subsets <m>B(x,\varepsilon)</m> generate the standard topology,
      the two topologies coincide.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <warning>
    <p>
      Consider the product topological space
      <me>
        \RR^{\omega} = \Map(\NN,\RR) = \prod_{n \in \NN} \RR
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This topology has a base
      <me>
        \left\{ \prod_{i=0}^N \left]a_i, b_i\right[ \times \prod_{i=N+1}^{\infty} \RR \right\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently,
      if <m>U</m> is an open subset of <m>\RR^{\omega}</m>,
      then for any point <m>x \in U</m>,
      there exists <m>N \in \NN</m> such that any point of the form
      <me>
        (x_0,x_1,\dots,x_N,y_{N+1},y_{N+2},\dots)
      </me>
      also lies in <m>U</m>.
      Conequently, the subset
      <me>
        \left]0,1\right[^{\omega} = \Map(\NN, \left]0,1\right[) \subset \RR^{\omega}
      </me>
      is not open!
    </p>
  </warning>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>S_1,\dots,S_n</m> is a finite collection of discrete topological spaces,
        then the product
        <me>
          \prod_{i=1}^n S_i = S_1 \times \cdots \times S_n
        </me>
        is also discrete.
        Indeed, for any <m>i</m> and any <m>x_i \in S_i</m>,
        the set <m>S_1 \times \cdots \times S_{i-1} \times \{x_i\} \times S_{i+1} \times \cdots \times S_n</m> is open,
        and since finite intersections of opens are open,
        it follows that any singleton <m>\{(x_1, \dots,
        x_n)\}</m> is open as well.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <warning>
    <p>
      If <m>\{S_i\}_{i\in\NN}</m> is a countable family of discrete finite sets of cardinality at least <m>2</m>,
      the product <m>S \coloneq \prod_{i \in \NN} S_i</m> is not discrete:
      if <m>(x_0, x_1, \dots) \in S</m> is a point,
      then the open sets are unions of sets of the form
      <me>
        \{x_0\} \times \cdots \times \{x_N\} \times \prod_{i=N+1}^{\infty} S_i
      </me>,
      so that no singleton is open.
      In fact, it is always homeomorphic to our old pal the Cantor space <m>C</m> <mdash/> irrespective of which finite sets <m>S_i</m> are chosen!
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        This is not obvious, or even easy to prove.
        I personally found this fact totally implausible the first time I read it.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </warning>
  <p>
    There is a <em>relative</em> form of the product as well.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>U</m>,
        <m>V</m>, and <m>X</m> be three topological spaces,
        and let <m>f\colon\fromto{U}{X}</m> and <m>g\colon\fromto{V}{X}</m> two continuous maps.
        Then the <term>fiber product</term>
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Please notice that this notation is a little sloppy.
          The fiber product <m>U \times_X V</m> depends on the maps <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
          If one needs to make the choice of maps explicit, one may write
          <me>
            U \operatorname{\times}_{f,X,g} V
          </me>,
          which is a bit busy, but very clear!
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        <m>U\times_XV</m> is the subspace
        <me>
          \left\{(u,v)\in U\times V : f(u)=g(v)\right\}
        </me>
        of <m>U\times V</m>.
        In this case, the square
        <me>
          <image>
             <latex-image> <![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline] \matrix(m)[matrix of math nodes, row sep=4ex, column sep=4ex, text height=1.5ex, text depth=0.25ex] {U\times_XV &amp; V \ U &amp; X \}; \path[>=stealth,->,font=] (m-1-1) edge node[above]{$\pr_2$} (m-1-2) edge node[left]{$\pr_1$} (m-2-1) (m-1-2) edge node[right]{$g$} (m-2-2) (m-2-1) edge node[below]{$f$} (m-2-2);\end{tikzpicture}]]> </latex-image>
          </image>
        </me>
        is sometimes called a <term>pullback square</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        As a special case of this construction,
        if <m>V</m> is a subspace of <m>X</m> and if <m>g</m> is the inclusion map <m>V \inclusion X</m>,
        then the fiber product <m>U \times_X V</m> is homeomorphic to the subspace <m>f^{-1}(V) \subseteq X</m>.
        In particular, if <m>V = \{x\}</m> for some <m>x\in X</m>,
        then the fiber product <m>U \times_X V</m> is the fiber <m>f^{-1}\{x\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f \colon X \to Y</m> be a continuous map of topological spaces.
        Then the <term>graph</term> of <m>f</m> is the fiber product
        <me>
          \Gamma(f) \coloneq X \operatorname{\times}_{f,Y,\id} Y \subseteq X \times Y
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The projection map <m>\pr_1 \colon \Gamma(f) \to X</m> is a homeomorphism.
