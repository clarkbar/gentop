    Let <m>X</m> be a set.
    Recall that an <em>equivalence relation</em>
    <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> is a relation that satisfies the following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every <m>x \in X</m>, one has <m>x \sim x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every <m>x,y \in X</m>,
          one has <m>x \sim y</m> if and only if <m>y \sim x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every <m>x,y,z \in X</m>,
          if <m>x \sim y</m> and <m>y \sim z</m>, then <m>x \sim z</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>x \in X</m>, one can form the
    <em>equivalence class</em>
    <m>[x] \coloneq \{ y \in X : y \sim x \}</m>.
    Now the set <m>X/\!\sim \colon \{ [x] : x \in X \}</m> of equivalence classes relative to <m>\sim</m> is called the <em>quotient</em>
    of <m>X</m> relative to <m>\sim</m>.
    The assignment <m>x \mapsto [x]</m> is a map <m>q \colon X \to X/\!\sim</m>,
    which is called the <em>quotient map</em>; The map <m>q</m> is a surjection,
    and it enjoys the following pleasant property:
    for every set <m>Y</m> and every map
    <m>f \colon X \to Y</m> with the property that for every
    <m>x,
    y \in X</m>, if <m>x \sim y</m>, then <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>,
    there exists a unique map <m>f' \colon X/\!\sim \to Y</m> such that <m>f' \circ q = f</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every surjection is secretly a quotient map:
    if <m>p \colon X \to T</m> is a surjection,
    then we may define an equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> in which
    <m>x \sim y</m> if and only if <m>p(x) = p(y)</m>.
    We may call this the equivalence relation
    <em>induced by</em> <m>p</m>.
    The unique map <m>p' \colon X/\!\sim \to T</m> through which <m>p</m> factors is then a bijection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, if <m>R</m> is <em>any</em> relation on <m>X</m>,
    then it <em>generates</em> an equivalence relation.
    That is, recall that <m>\sim</m> is
    <em>really</em> a subset
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      consisting of those pairs <m>(x,y)</m> such that <m>x R y</m>
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    of <m>X \times X</m>.
    If we look at the collection of all subsets
    <m>Q \in \PP(X \times X)</m> that are equivalence relations that contain <m>R</m>,
    then the intersection of all these <m>Q</m> is itself an equivalence relation that contains <m>R</m>.
    This intersection is the <em>equivalence relation generated by</em> <m>R</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space,
        let <m>Y</m> be a set, and let <m>p \colon X \to Y</m> be a surjection.
        The final topology with respect to <m>p</m> is the
        <term>quotient topology</term> on <m>Y</m>;
        this is the finest topology on <m>Y</m> such that the map <m>p</m> is continuous.
        We call <m>p</m> the <term>quotient map</term>.
        We also say that <m>Y</m> is the
        <term>quotient space</term>
        of <m>X</m> under the equivalence relation induced by <m>p</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The ability to form quotients of topological spaces is really the most powerful motivation for defining abstract topological spaces in the first place.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the real line <m>\RR</m>,
        and consider the equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> in which
        <m>x \sim y</m> if and only if <m>y-x</m> is an integer.
        Now consider the map <m>t \mapsto \exp(2\pi t)</m>;
        this is a continuous map <m>e \colon \RR \to S^1</m>.
        By the discussion above,
        there exists a unique map <m>f \colon \RR/\!\sim \to S^1</m> such that if <m>q \colon \RR \to \RR/\!\sim</m> is the quotient map,
        then <m>f \circ q = e</m>.
        This map is continuous with respect to the quotient topology on <m>\RR/\sim</m>.
        In fact, <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, consider the closed interval <m>[0,1]</m>,
        and consider the equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> generated by the requirement that <m>0\sim 1</m>.
        Then the inclusion map <m>[0,1] \inclusion \RR</m> descends to a continuous map <m>[0,1]/\sim \to \RR/\!\sim</m>,
        and this map is a homeomorphism as well.
        This justifies our intuition that the circle is obtained from the interval by identifying the endpoints.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m> be a subspace,
        and let <m>k \in \NN</m> be a natural number.
        Then we have the subspace <m>X^k \subseteq \RR^{nk}</m>.
        Furthermore, we can define the subsspace
        <me>
          Y \coloneq \{(x_1,\dots,x_k) \in X^k : (\forall i \neq j)(x_i \neq x_j) \} \subseteq X^k
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now conisder the equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>Y</m> in which
        <m>(x_1, \dots,
        x_k) \sim (y_1,\dots, y_k)</m> if and only if there exists a permutation
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          We write <m>\Sigma_k</m> for the set of permutations of the set <m>\{1,\dots,k\}</m>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        <m>\sigma \in \Sigma_k</m> such that for each <m>i</m>,
        one has <m>y_i = x_{\sigma(i)}</m>.
        Now we can think of the points of the quotient space
        <m>C_k(X) \coloneq Y/\!\sim</m> as <em>unordered</em>
        collections of <m>k</m> points on <m>X</m>.
        This space <m>C_k(X)</m> is called the
        <term>configuration space</term>
        of <m>k</m> marked points on <m>X</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space <m>C_0(X)</m> has exactly one point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space <m>C_1(X)</m> is <m>X</m> itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space <m>C_2(X)</m> is much more interesting.
        For example, <m>C_2(\RR^2) \cong \RR^3 \times S^1</m>.
        The space <m>C_2(S^1)</m> is the
        <em>M&#xf6;bius band</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As <m>k</m> goes higher, these spaces become even more involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spaces <m>C_k(X)</m> are extremely important in physics,
        since we may think of them as the space of possible states of <m>k</m> noninteracting particles on <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional real vector space.
        Since <m>V</m> is a finite dimensional,
        it is isomorphic to <m>\RR^n</m>.
        Let us transport the topology from <m>\RR^n</m> to <m>V</m> along such an isomorphism.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          That is, if <m>\phi \colon V \to \RR^n</m> is a linear isomorphism,
          then <m>U \subseteq V</m> is open if and only if <m>\phi(V) \subseteq \RR^n</m> is open.
          As an exercise, you can show that the topology is the same,
          irrespective of which isomorphism <m>\phi</m> you select. (Hint:
          linear isomorphisms from <m>\RR^n</m> to itself are always homeomorphisms!)
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        Thus <m>V</m> is homeomorphic to <m>\RR^n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every <m>k \in \NN^{\ast}</m>,
        the set <m>V^k</m> of <m>k</m>-tuples
        <m>(v_1, \dots,
        v_k)</m> of vectors in <m>V</m> is also a vector space,
        and thus also a topological space that is homeomorphic to <m>\RR^{nk}</m>.
        Now we let <m>L_{\RR}(k,V) \subseteq V^k</m> be the set of <m>k</m>-tuples
        <m>(v_1, \dots,
        v_k)</m> of vectors in <m>V</m> that are linearly independent,
        so that they span a <m>k</m>-dimensional subspace of <m>V</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we define an equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>L_{\RR}(k, V)</m> by the rule that
        <m>(v_1, \dots,
        v_k) \sim (w_1, \dots, w_k)</m> if and only if their spans are equal
        (as subspaces of <m>V</m>).
        The quotient space <m>G_{\RR}(k,V) \coloneq L_{\RR}(k,V)/\!\sim</m> is called the <term>Grassmannian</term>
        of <m>k</m>-dimensional subspaces of <m>V</m>.
        The points of <m>G_{\RR}(k,V)</m> are <m>k</m>-dimensional real linear subspaces of <m>V</m>.
        One often writes <m>G_{\RR}(k,n)</m> as a shorthand for <m>G_{\RR}(k, \RR^n)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the particular case in which <m>k=1</m>,
        the space <m>G_{\RR}(1,n)</m> is the space of lines through the origin of <m>\RR^n</m>;
        this is also called the (real) <term>projective space</term> <m>\PP^{n-1}_{\RR}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can do this same thing with <m>\CC</m> in place
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          That is, we can look at a finite dimensional complex vector space V with the topology transported from <m>\CC^n \cong \RR^{2n}</m>;
          we can consider the subspace <m>L(k, V)</m> of <m>\CC</m>-linearly independent <m>k</m>-tuples of <m>V^k</m>;
          and we can contemplate the quotient <m>G(k, V)</m> of <m>k</m>-dimensional complex subspaces of <m>V</m>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        of <m>\RR</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, <m>G(k,n)</m> is the space of <em>complex</em>
        lines through the origin in <m>\CC^n</m>;
        this is called the (complex) <term>projective space</term> <m>\PP^{n-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces,
    and let <m>p \colon X \to Y</m> be a continuous surjection.
    Then <m>p</m> need not be a quotient map.
    For example,
    the map <m>e \colon \left]0,1\right] \to S^1</m> given by
    <m>t \mapsto \exp(2\pi t)</m> is not a quotient map:
    even though <m>e^{-1}(e(\left]1/2,1/2\right])) = \left]1/2,1/2\right]</m> is open,
    the subset <m>e(\left]1/2,1/2\right]) \subseteq S^1</m> is not.
    If <m>p</m> is an <em>open map</em> <mdash/> that is,
    if it carries open sets to open sets <mdash/> then it is a quotient map.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>\{X_a\}_{a\in A}</m> be an indexed family of sets.
    Then the <term>coproduct of sets</term>
    is by definition the union
    <me>
      \coprod_{a\in A}X_a\coloneq\bigcup_{a\in A}X_a\times\{a\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is engineered precisely so that a map out of the coproduct is determined by each of its components.
    More precisely, the coproduct is equipped with inclusion maps
    <me>
      \iota_b\colon\fromto{X_b}{\coprod_{a\in A}X_a}
    </me>,
    one for every <m>b\in A</m>, given by <m>\iota_b(x)=(x,b)</m>.
    For any set <m>Y</m>, and for any collection
    <m>\{ f_a \colon X_a \to Y\}_{a\in A}</m> of maps, there exists a unique map
    <me>
      f \colon \coprod_{a \in A} X_a \to Y
    </me>
    such that for each <m>a\in A</m>,
    one has <m>f \circ \iota_a = f_a</m>.
    Thus composition with the inclusions induces a bijection
    <me>
      \prod_{a\in A}-\circ \iota_{a} \colon\fromto{\Map\left(\coprod_{a\in A}X_a,Y\right)}{\prod_{a\in A}\Map(X_a,Y)}
    </me>.

        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space,
        and let <m>A\subseteq X</m> a subspace.
        Consider the map <m>q\colon\fromto{X}{(X-A)\sqcup\{X-A\}}</m> defined by

        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We define <m>X/A</m> as the set
        <m>(X-A)\sqcup\{X-A\}</m> equipped with the final topology with respect to <m>q</m>.

        Then the space <m>D^n/S^{n-1}</m> is homeomorphic to <m>(\RR^n)^+</m>,

        Let <m>A = (A,\delta)</m> be a discrete topological space.
        Suppose <m>f\colon\fromto{X}{A}</m> a continuous map.
        Then we have a bijection <m>G \colon \coprod_{a\in A}f^{-1}\{a\} \to X</m>.
        Let us show that this is a homeomorphism,
        where the right hand side is given the coproduct topology
        (and the fibers <m>f^{-1}\{a\} \subseteq X</m> are given the subspace topology).
        By construction, the map <m>G</m> is continuous.
        It remains to show that <m>G^{-1}</m> is continuous;
        let <m>U \subseteq \coprod_{a\in A}f^{-1}\{a\}</m> be an open subset.
        Then <m>U \cap f^{-1}\{a\}</m> is open in <m>f^{-1}\{a\}</m>,
        and so since <m>U</m> is the union of these intersections,
        it suffices to prove that any open subset of <m>f^{-1}\{a\}</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
        Indeed, this is true, since <m>f^{-1}\{a\}</m> is itself open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, if <m>\{X_a\}_{a\in A}</m> is an indexed family of topological spaces,
        then define the map

          g\colon\fromto{\coprod_{a\in A}X_a}{A}

        such that <m>g(x)=a</m> if and only if <m>x\in X_a</m>.
        The map <m>g</m> is continuous.

      <p>
        In other words,
        a decomposition of a toploogical space into a coproduct of topological spaces is equivalent to a continuous map into a discrete topological space.

    Much of the story of topology is the story of

        Here's a standard way to build a new space from an old one.
