    There are a lot of different characterisations of compactness out there.
    We'll give them all,

  <fn>
      or, at least, all the ones I know about!

      This is an important principle in mathematics:
      <term>never have only one definition of any notion</term>.
      Instead, when possible,
      have multiple equivalent characterisations of the same idea.
      Then use whichever one is best adapted for whichever problem you happen to encounter.

      Suppose <m>f</m> closed,

        f(Z)=f(\overline{Z})\supseteq\overline{f(Z)}

      Conversely, suppose that <m>f</m> satisfies the condition that for any closed subset <m>Z\subseteq X</m>,
      the direct image <m>f(Z)</m> is closed,

      Let <m>Z \subseteq Y</m> be a subset such that <m>f^{-1}(Z) \subseteq X</m> is closed.

      clearly <m>y\in V</m>, and since <m>f</m> is closed, <m>V</m> is open.
      Now an element of <m>f^{-1}(V)</m> does not lie in <m>f^{-1}(f(X \smallsetminus U))</m>,

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let us assume the first condition and prove the second.
      So let <m>T</m> be a topological space and <m>t\in T</m>,
      and let <m>U</m> an open set of
      <m>T\times X</m> containing <m>\{t\}\times X</m>.
      Now let <m>\UU</m> be the collection of those open subsets
      <m>W\subseteq X</m> such that for some open neighbourhood <m>E</m> of <m>t</m>,
      one has <m>E\times W\subseteq U</m>.
      The collection <m>\UU</m> covers
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Since <m>U</m> is open in the product topology, for every <m>x\in X</m>,
        the point <m>(t,x)</m> lies in an open neighbourhood of the form
        <m>E\times W</m> such that <m>E\times W\subseteq U</m>
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      <m>X</m>.
      The first condition now ensures that there is a finite subcover <m>\UU_0\subseteq\UU</m>.
      For each <m>W\in\UU_0</m>,
      select an open neighbourhood <m>E_W</m> of <m>t</m> such that <m>E_W\times W\subseteq U</m>.
      Now set
      <me>
        V\coloneq\bigcap_{W\in\UU_0}E_W;
      </me>
      so that <m>V</m> is an open neighbourhood of <m>t</m>,
      and <m>V\times W\subseteq U</m> for any <m>W\in\UU_0</m>.
      Hence
      <me>
        V\times X=\bigcup_{W\in\UU_0}V\times W\subseteq U
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This verifies the second condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equivalence of the second and third conditions is the content of the previous proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us assume the third condition and prove the fourth.
      So let <m>\ZZ\subseteq\PP(X)</m> be a collection of closed subsets of <m>X</m>,
      and assume that for any finite subset <m>\ZZ_0\subseteq\ZZ</m>,
      the intersection <m>\cap\ZZ_0</m> is nonempty.
      Now let <m>T</m> be the set <m>X\sqcup\{\infty\}</m>,
      which we topologise with the coarsest topology such that
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Please note that this is weird!
        The topology we're putting on <m>T</m> really has nothing to do with the topology we have on <m>X</m>;
        it's really all about <m>\ZZ</m>.
        We're using the class <m>\ZZ</m> of <em>closed</em>
        subsets of <m>X</m> to describe some
        <em>open</em> sets of <m>T</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>any</em> subset <m>S\subseteq X</m> is open in <m>T</m>, and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          for any <m>Z\in\ZZ</m>,
          the set <m>Z\sqcup\{\infty\}</m> is open in <m>T</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any open neighbourhood of <m>\infty</m> contains a finite intersection of elements of <m>\ZZ</m>.
      Since all such intersections are nonempty,
      any open neighbourhood of <m>\infty</m> contains at least one point of <m>X</m>.
      Hence <m>\infty</m> is not open or,
      equivalently, <m>X\subseteq T</m> is dense.
      Now let
      <me>
        \Delta \coloneq \{(x,x) : x\in X\} \subseteq T\times X
      </me>,
      and consider the closed set <m>\pr_1(\overline{\Delta})\subseteq T</m>.
      Clearly <m>X=\pr_1(\Delta)\subseteq\pr_1(\overline{\Delta})</m>,
      so <m>\pr_1(\overline{\Delta})=T</m>.
      In other words, <m>\overline{\Delta}</m> contains a point
      <m>(\infty,
      x)</m> for some <m>x\in X</m>.
      Thus for every <m>Z\in\ZZ</m> and every open neighbourhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m>,
      one has <m>((Z\sqcup\{\infty\})\times U)\cap\Delta\neq\varnothing</m>, and so
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        since a point <m>(u,u)</m> of that intersection has the property that <m>u\in Z\cap U</m>
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      <m>Z\cap U\neq\varnothing</m>.
      Thus <m>x</m> is close to every <m>Z\in\ZZ</m>,
      whence <m>x</m> lies in every <m>Z\in\ZZ</m>,
      whence <m>x\in\cap\ZZ</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let's assume the fourth condition and prove the first.
      Let <m>\UU\subseteq\PP(X)</m> be an open cover of <m>X</m>.
      Now let <m>\ZZ</m> be the set of complements of elements
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Hence <m>Z\in\ZZ</m> if and only if <m>X \smallsetminus Z\in\UU</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      of <m>\UU</m>.
      Clearly <m>\cap\ZZ=X-\cup\UU=\varnothing</m>,
      so by the fourth condition,
      there exists a finite subset
      <m>\ZZ_0\subseteq\ZZ</m> such that <m>\cap\ZZ_0=\varnothing</m>.
      Now let <m>\UU_0</m> be the set of complements of elements
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Hence <m>U\in\UU_0</m> if and only if <m>X \smallsetminus U\in\ZZ_0</m>.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      of <m>\ZZ_0</m>.
      Now <m>\cup\UU_0=X \smallsetminus \cap\ZZ_0=X</m>,
      whence <m>\UU_0\subseteq\UU</m> is a finite subcover.

      By definition of <m>c</m>,
      one has <m>[a,c-\varepsilon/2]\subseteq\cup\UU_0</m> for a finite subset <m>\UU_0\subseteq\UU</m>;
      hence the union of the elements of

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let us show that the first of these conditions implies the second.
      Suppose <m>A</m> compact,
      and suppose <m>(x_i)_{i\geq 0}</m> a sequence of points in <m>A</m>.
      If there were no convergent subsequence of <m>(x_i)_{i\geq 0}</m>,
      then the set <m>\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}</m> would be a closed subset of <m>A</m>,
      hence compact,
      and there would be a sequence
      <m>\varepsilon_i</m> of positive real numbers such that the balls <m>B^n(x_i,\varepsilon_i)</m> would be disjoint.
      But then <m>\{B^n(x_i,\varepsilon_i)\}_{i\geq 0}</m> would be an open cover of
      <m>\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}</m> with no finite subcover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us show that the second property implies the third.
      Suppose <m>A</m> has the property that every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
      Then <m>A</m> must be bounded,
      since otherwise there exists a sequence
      <m>(x_i)_{i\geq 0}</m> of points in <m>A</m> such that <m>\|x_i\|\to\infty</m>.
      It must also be closed, since if <m>x\in\overline{A}-A</m>,
      one can construct a sequence of points of <m>A</m> converging to <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let us show that the third condition implies the first.
      Suppose <m>A</m> is closed and bounded.
      Since <m>A</m> is bounded,
      it is contained in a box <m>[-a,a]^n</m> for some <m>a\geq 0</m>.
      Since every closed subspace of a compact space is compact,
      it is enough to show that <m>[-a,a]^n</m> is compact.
      Since a finite product of compacta is compact,
      it is enough to show that any closed interval is compact,
      and we've already shown this.
