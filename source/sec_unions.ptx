  <title>Unions</title>
  <p>
    For any set <m>X</m>, we also permit ourselves to form the
    <term>union</term> <m>\cup X</m>.
    This is the set whose elements are the elements of the elements of <m>X</m>;
    that is, <m>A\in\cup X</m> if and only if there exists an element <m>S\in X</m> such that <m>A\in S</m>.
    If <m>X=\{A,B\}</m>, then we write
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      This <m>\cup X</m> notation may be unfamiliar to you.
      You might be happier with something like <m>\bigcup_{S \in X} S</m>,
      which means the same thing.
      The <m>\cup X</m> notation is standard in set theory, however.
    </p>

  <p>
    <m>A\cup B</m> for <m>\cup X</m>.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We can start building the <term>finite von Neumann ordinals</term>
        according to the following recipe:
        first, <m>0\coloneq\varnothing</m>.
        Then, for every von Neumann ordinal <m>n</m>,
        one can create its <term>successor von Neumann ordinal</term>
        <me>
          n+1\coloneq n\cup\{n\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the first few von Neumann ordinals look like this:
        <md>
          <mrow>0 \amp  \coloneq \varnothing;</mrow>
          <mrow>1 \amp  \coloneq \{0\}=\{\varnothing\};</mrow>
          <mrow>2 \amp  \coloneq \{0,1\}=\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\};</mrow>
          <mrow>3 \amp  \coloneq \{0,1,2\}=\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\},\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}\};</mrow>
          <mrow>4 \amp  \coloneq \{0,1,2,3\}=\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\},\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\},\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\},\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}\}\};</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  \textit{etc.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>n</m> is a finite von Neumann ordinal,
        then for every <m>\alpha,\beta\in n</m>,
        exactly one of the following is the case:
        <me>
          \alpha\in\beta ; \qquad \alpha=\beta ;  \textit{or}  \alpha \ni \beta
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The axioms then let you build the first
    <term>infinite von Neumann ordinal</term> <m>\omega</m>,
    which is the set of all the finite von Neumann ordinals.
    Once you have that, you can build the successor to <m>\omega</m>:
    <me>
      \omega+1\coloneq\omega\cup\{\omega\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Wait, isn't that like <m>\infty+1</m>?
    Isn't that <m>\infty</m> again?</em>
    That sort of thing is true if you're talking about <term>cardinals</term>.
    Here, we're talking about <term>ordinals</term>,
    and the distinction is important.
    We'll get into this more when we talk about number systems in the next section.
    But we absolutely can construct
    <me>
      \omega+1,\omega+2,\dots,2\omega=\omega+\omega
    </me>,
    where <m>2\omega=\omega+\omega</m> is the set
    <me>
      \{0,1,2,\dots,\omega,\omega+1,\omega+2,\dots\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, you can build <m>3\omega,4\omega,\dots</m>,
    and then even <m>\omega^2,\omega^3,\dots</m>,
    and even <m>\omega^\omega</m>.
    The key point is that each ordinal is the set of all the ordinals smaller than it.
    We'll investigate this more deeply in the next section.

  <p>
    A key construction for building
    <q>big</q>
    sets is the <em>power set</em> construction.
    To explain, a <term>subset</term>
    of a set <m>X</m> is a set <m>S</m> such that for any <m>s\in S</m>,
    one has <m>s\in X</m> as well;
    in this case, we write <m>S\subseteq X</m>.
    The axioms of set theory permit us to form the
    <term>power set</term> <m>\PP(X)</m>,
    which is the set of all subsets of <m>X</m>,
    so that <m>S\in\PP(X)</m> if and only if <m>S\subseteq X</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set <m>\PP(\varnothing)</m> is <m>\{\varnothing\}</m>.
        The set <m>\PP(\PP(\varnothing))</m> is <m>\{\varnothing, \{\varnothing\}\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
