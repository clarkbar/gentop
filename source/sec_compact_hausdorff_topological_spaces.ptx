        A topological space <m>X</m> is said to be <term>Hausdorff</term>
        if for any two points <m>x,y\in X</m>,
        there exist open neighbourhoods <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>U\cap V=\varnothing</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Any discrete topological space is Hausdorff.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Any subspace of Euclidean space is Hausdorff:
        for any two points <m>x,y\in X</m>,
        if <m>r\coloneq d(x,y)/2</m>,
        then the balls <m>B(x,r)</m> and <m>B(y,r)</m> are disjoint.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <counterexample>
  <statement>
  <p>
    The indiscrete topology on a set <m>X</m> is not Hausdorff unless <m>\# X\leq 1</m>.
  </p>
  </statement>
  </counterexample>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Any subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>(X,\tau)</m> is Hausdorff,
        then for any topology <m>\tau'</m> on <m>X</m> that is finer than <m>\tau</m>,
        the topological space <m>(X,\tau')</m> is Hausdorff as well.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    This points in the opposite direction from compactness.
    Whereas Hausdorffitude is stable under passage to a finer topology,
    compactness is stable under passage to a coarser topology.

  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a Hausdorff space,
        and let <m>K\subseteq X</m> a compact subspace.
        Then <m>K</m> is closed in <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>y\in X \smallsetminus K</m>.
      We aim to prove that there is an open neighbourhood <m>V</m> of <m>y</m> that does not intersect <m>K</m>.
      For each point <m>x\in K</m>,
      select open neighbourhoods <m>U_x</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V_x</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>U_x\cap V_x=\varnothing</m>.
      Now <m>\{U_x\cap K : x\in X\}</m> is an open cover of <m>K</m>,
      so it contains a finite subcover <m>\{U_{x_1}\cap K,\dots,U_{x_n}\cap K\}</m>.
      Now <m>V\coloneq V_{x_1}\cap\dots\cap V_{x_n}</m> is an open neighbourhood of <m>y</m> that does not intersect <m>K</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>X</m> a set with two topologies <m>\tau</m> and <m>\tau'</m> such that <m>\tau</m> is coarser than
        (or equal to)
        <m>\tau'</m>.
        Assume that <m>\tau</m> is Hausdorff and that <m>\tau'</m> is compact.
        Then <m>\tau=\tau'</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>K\subseteq X</m> a <m>\tau'</m>-closed subset,
        hence compact with the subspace topology.
        Since the identity is continuous
        <m>\fromto{(X,\tau')}{(X,\tau)}</m> and the continuous image of a compactum is compact,
        it follows that <m>K</m> is compact as a subspace of <m>(X,\tau)</m>.
        The previous lemma now implies that <m>K</m> is <m>\tau</m>-closed.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>X</m> a Hausdorff space,
        and suppose <m>K,L\subseteq X</m> two disjoint compact subspaces.
        Then there exist open sets
        <m>U,V\subseteq X</m> such that <m>K\subseteq U</m>,
        <m>L\subseteq V</m>, and <m>U\cap V=\varnothing</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      For every pair of points <m>x\in K</m> and <m>y\in L</m>,
      select open neighbourhoods <m>U_{x,y}</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V_{x,y}</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>U_{x,y}\cap V_{x,y}=\varnothing</m>.
      For any <m>y\in L</m>,
      we obtain an open cover <m>\{U_{x,y}\cap K : x\in K\}</m> of <m>K</m>;
      it contains a finite subcover <m>\{U_{x_1,y}\cap K,\dots,U_{x_m,y}\cap K\}</m>.
      We form disjoint open sets
      <me>
        U_y\coloneq\bigcup_{i=1}^mU_{x_i,y}\text{ and } V_y\coloneq\bigcap_{i=1}^mV_{x_i,y}
      </me>
      such that <m>U_y\supseteq K</m> and <m>y\in V_y</m>.
      Thus we obtain an open cover <m>\{V_y\cap L : y\in L\}</m> of <m>L</m>;
      it contains a finite subcover <m>\{V_{y_1}\cap L,\dots,V_{y_n}\cap L\}</m>.
      We form disjoint open sets
      <me>
        U\coloneq\bigcap_{j=1}^nU_{y_j}\text{ and } V\coloneq\bigcup_{j=1}^nV_{y_j}
      </me>
      such that <m>U\supseteq K</m> and <m>V\supseteq L</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A topological space <m>X</m> is Hausdorff if and only if,
        for any point <m>x\in X</m>,
        the intersection <m>I_x</m> of all
        <term>closed neighbourhoods</term>
        <mdash/> i.e., all closed subsets of <m>X</m> that contain an open neighbourhood of <m>x</m> <mdash/> of <m>x</m> is the singleton <m>\{x\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>X</m> is Hausdorff, and let <m>x\in X</m>.
      Surely <m>x\in I_x</m>,
      and we claim that any point <m>y\in X\smallsetminus\{x\}</m> is not in <m>I</m>.
      Indeed, for any such point,
      one may find disjoint open neighbourhoods <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>y</m>,
      whence <m>X \smallsetminus V</m> is a closed neighbourhood of <m>x</m> not containing <m>y</m>.
      Thus <m>I=\{x\}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, suppose that,
      for any point <m>x\in X</m>, one has <m>I_x=\{x\}</m>.
      Suppose <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> two distinct points of <m>X</m>.
      Then since <m>I_x=\{x\}</m>,
      there exists a closed neighbourhood <m>W</m> of <m>x</m> not containing <m>y</m>,
      and now the interior <m>\iota W</m> and the complement
      <m>X \smallsetminus W</m> are disjoint open neighbourhoods of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,
      respectively.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A topological space <m>X</m> is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal
        <me>
          \Delta_X \coloneq \{ (x,x)\in X\times X \}
        </me>
        is a closed subspace of <m>X\times X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The key point is that if <m>U,V \subseteq X</m> are subsets,
      then <m>U \cap V = \varnothing</m> if and only if <m>(U \times V) \cap \Delta_X = \varnothing</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>X</m> is Hausdorff.
      Let <m>(x,y) \in (X \times X) \smallsetminus \Delta_X</m>.
      Choose an open neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>U \cap V = \varnothing</m>.
      Thus <m>U \times V</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>(X \times X) \smallsetminus \Delta_X</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, assume that <m>\Delta_X</m> is closed in <m>X \times X</m>.
      Now let <m>x, y \in X</m> be points such that <m>x \neq y</m>.
      There exist open neighborhoods <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>(U \times V) \subseteq (X \times X) \smallsetminus \Delta_X</m>.
      It follows that <m>U \cap V = \varnothing</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are topological spaces,
        and <m>Y</m> is Hausdorff,
        then for any continuous map
        <m>f\colon X \to Y</m>, the <term>graph</term>
        <me>
          \Gamma_f \coloneq \{ (x,y) \in X\times Y : f(x)=y \}
        </me>
        is closed in <m>X\times Y</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>
  <proof>
    <p>
      This follows from the fact that <m>\Gamma_f = (f \times \id)^{-1}(\Delta_Y)</m>.
