  <title>Bijections</title>
  <p>
    One important kind of map is the <term>bijection</term>.
    When mathematicians are presented with a set, for many purposes,
    they won't be too very worried about what the elements are,
    but what structures they have.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea is that a bijection of sets is meant to be a
    <q>mere labelling</q>
    of the elements of a set <m>S</m> by the elements of a set <m>T</m>.
    That labelling is meant to be a perfect match of information:
    you should never use the same label twice,
    and all the labels should be used.
    So a <term>bijection</term> of sets is a map
    <m>f\colon S \to T</m> such that for any <m>t\in T</m>,
    there exists a unique <m>s\in S</m> such that <m>f(s)=t</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> be two sets.
        There is a bijection <m>\sigma \colon S \times T \to T \times S</m>,
        which is given by <m>\sigma(\angs{s,t}) = \angs{t,s}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    If <m>f \colon S \to T</m> is a bijection,
    then there exists a map <m>g \colon T \to S</m> such that <m>g \circ f = \id</m>,
    and <m>f \circ g = \id</m>.
    To prove this, let us construct <m>g</m>:
    the function <m>f</m> gives us a subset
    <m>\Gamma(f) \subseteq S \times T</m> such that for any <m>s \in S</m>,
    there exists a unique <m>t \in T</m> such that <m>\angs{s, t} \in \Gamma(f)</m>.
    So now let's define <m>g = \angs{T, S, \Gamma(g)}</m>,
    where <m>\Gamma(g) = \{ \angs{t,s} \in T \times S : \angs{s, t} \in \Gamma(f) \}</m>.
    Of course <m>\Gamma(g)</m> makes perfect sense as a subset,
    but we aren't done:
    we have to show it is a map from <m>S</m> to <m>T</m>.
    For this we can use the fact that,
    since <m>f</m> is a bigjection, for every <m>t \in T</m>,
    there exists a unique <m>s \in S</m> such that <m>\angs{s,t} \in \Gamma(f)</m>.
    In other words, for every <m>t \in T</m>,
    there exists a unique <m>s \in S</m> such that <m>\angs{t,s} \in \Gamma(g)</m>.
    Thus if <m>t \in T</m>, then
    <m>g(t) \in S</m> is the unique element such that <m>f(g(t) = t</m>.
    Thus <m>f \circ g = \id</m>.
    To see that <m>g \circ f = \id</m>, let <m>s \in S</m>;
    then <m>g(f(s)) \in S</m> is the unique element such that <m>f(g(f(s))) = f(s)</m>.
    But since this element of <m>S</m> is
    <em>unique</em> with this property,
    it follows that <m>g(f(s)) = s</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The converse is also correct:
    if <m>f \colon S \to T</m> is a map such that there exists a function <m>g \colon T \to S</m> such that
    <m>g \circ f =\id</m> and <m>f \circ g = \id</m>,
    then <m>f</m> is a bijection.
    Indeed, let <m>t \in T</m> be an element;
    we aim to prove that there exists a unique element <m>s \in S</m> such that <m>t = f(s)</m>.
    The function <m>g</m> provides us with exactly such an element:
    <m>g(t) \in T</m> is an element, and <m>t = f(g(t))</m>.
    Now suppose that <m>s'\in S</m> is an element such that <m>t = f(s')</m>;
    we see that <m>g(t) = g(f(s')) = s'</m>,
    so we have the uniqueness we sought!
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, we say that <m>g</m> is the
    <em>inverse</em> of <m>f</m>,
    and we sometimes write <m>f^{-1}</m> for <m>g</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> be two sets.
        Assume that <m>f \colon S \to T</m> is a bijection between them.
        Now let <m>U</m> be another set.
        We can define a map <m>F \colon \Map(T, U) \to \Map(S, U)</m> by the assignment <m>\alpha \mapsto \alpha \circ f</m>.
        Let's see that this is a bijection.
        If <m>g = f^{-1} \colon T \to S</m> is the inverse to <m>f</m>,
        then we can define a map <m>G \colon \Map(S, U) \to \Map(T, U)</m> by the assignment <m>\beta \mapsto \beta \circ g</m>.
        Now <m>F \circ G = \id</m> and <m>G \circ F = \id</m>.
      </p>
