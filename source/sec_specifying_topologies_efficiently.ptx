  <title>Specifying topologies efficiently</title>
  <p>
    A common way of specifying a topology is to speak of the
    <em>coarsest topology such that blah</em>
    or the <em>finest topology such that blah</em>.
    Specifying a topology this way has its pluses and minuses:
    on one hand,
    these properties often make it easy to verify features of these topologies,
    but on the other hand,
    one has to do the work to actually confirm that a finest or coarsest topology with the given property exists.
    Let's do some of that work now.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space,
        and let <m>Y\subseteq X</m> is a subspace,
        then <m>Y</m> has the coarsest topology such that the inclusion map <m>\into{Y}{X}</m> is continuous.

    Here's a handy fact of set theory that we'll be using a lot in this section.
    Let <m>X</m> be a set, and let
    <m>A \subseteq \PP(X)</m> be a collection of subsets of <m>X</m>.
    Then the following are equivalent for a subset <m>U \subseteq X</m>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set <m>U</m> can be expressed as the union of elements of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For every point <m>u \in U</m>,
          there exists an element <m>V \in A</m> such that <m>u \in V \subseteq U</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>X</m> a set, and suppose <m>B\subseteq\PP(X)</m>.
        Then there is a unique coarsest topology <m>\tau_B</m> on <m>X</m> such that every element of <m>B</m> is open.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let's define <m>O\subseteq\PP(X)</m> as the collection of all those subsets
      <m>U\subseteq X</m> such that for any point <m>x\in U</m>,
      there exist finitely many elements
      <m>V_1,\dots,V_n\in B</m> such that <m>x\in V_1\cap\cdots\cap V_n\subseteq U</m>.
      It is easy to see that <m>O</m> is a system of open sets for a topology on <m>X</m>.
      We claim that this is the desired topology <m>\tau_B</m>.
      Indeed, every element of <m>B</m> is an element of <m>O</m>,
      and at the same time,
      every element of <m>O</m> is a union of finite intersections of elements of <m>B</m>,
      and hence must be open in any topology in which the elements of <m>B</m> are open.

    <statement>
      <p>
        In the situation of the previous exercise,
        one says that <m>B</m> <term>generates</term>
        the topology on <m>X</m> or that <m>B</m> is a <term>subbase</term>
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Some authors require additionally that <m>B</m>
          <em>cover</em> <m>X</m>;
          that is, that <m>\cup B=X</m>.
          Not us, though.

  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a set,
        and let <m>F \coloneq \left\{ f_{\alpha} \colon \fromto{X}{Y_{\alpha}} \right\}_{\alpha\in A}</m> be a family of maps.
        Suppose that each target <m>Y_{\alpha}</m> is equipped with a topology <m>\tau_{\alpha}</m>.
        Then there exists a unique coarsest topology on <m>X</m> such that each <m>f_{\alpha}</m> is continuous.
        This is called the <term>initial topology</term>
        on <m>X</m> with respect to <m>F</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      The desired topology on <m>X</m> is the one generated by the set
      <me>
        \{f_{\alpha}^{-1}(U) : (\alpha\in A)\wedge(U\subseteq Y_{\alpha}\text{ is open } ) \}
      </me>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a set, and let
        <m>F \coloneq \left\{ f_{\alpha} \colon \fromto{X}{Y_{\alpha}} \right\}_{\alpha\in A}</m> be an indexed family of maps.
        Suppose that each target <m>Y_{\alpha}</m> is equipped with a topology <m>\tau_{\alpha}</m>,
        and equip <m>X</m> with the initial topology with respect to <m>F</m>.
        For any topological space <m>X'</m>,
        a map <m>g \colon \fromto{X'}{X}</m> is continuous if and only if,
        for each <m>\alpha\in A</m>,
        the composite <m>f_{\alpha}\circ g</m> is continuous.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>g</m> is continuous,
      then since the composition of continuous maps is continuous,
      it follows that each <m>f_{\alpha} \circ g</m> is continuous too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, let us assume that each <m>f_{\alpha} \circ g</m> is continuous.
      Now let <m>U \subseteq X</m> be an open set.
      Since <m>X</m> has the initial topology with respect to <m>F</m>,
      it follows that <m>U</m> is a union of finite intersections of sets of the form <m>f_{\alpha}^{-1}(V)</m> for
      <m>\alpha \in A</m> and <m>V \subseteq Y_{\alpha}</m> open.
      Consequently,
      <m>g^{-1}(U)</m> is a union of finite intersections of sets of the form <m>g^{-1}(f_{\alpha}^{-1}(V))</m> for
      <m>\alpha \in A</m> and <m>V \subseteq Y_{\alpha}</m>.
      Since <m>f_{\alpha} \circ g</m> is continuous,
      it follows that <m>g^{-1}(U)</m> is open.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Dually, but simpler, suppose <m>X</m> a set,
    and suppose <m>F \coloneq \{ f_{\alpha} \colon \fromto{Y_{\alpha}}{X} \}_{\alpha\in A}</m> an indexed family of maps.
    Suppose that each source <m>Y_{\alpha}</m> is endowed with a topology <m>\tau_{\alpha}</m>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          There exists a unique finest topology on <m>X</m> relative to which every map of <m>F</m> is continuous.
          This is called the <term>final topology</term>
          with respect to <m>F</m>.
          A subset <m>U \subseteq X</m> is open with respect to the final topology if and only if,
          for every <m>\alpha \in A</m>,
          the inverse image <m>f_{\alpha}^{-1}(U) \subseteq Y_{\alpha}</m> is open.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A map <m>g\colon\fromto{X}{X'}</m> is continuous if and only if,
          for each <m>\alpha\in A</m>,
          the composite <m>g\circ f_{\alpha}</m> is continuous.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

        Each of the following sets form a subbase for the standard topology on <m>\RR</m>;

              the set of all open subsets of <m>\RR</m>;

        Let <m>X \subseteq \RR^n</m> be a subspace of Euclidean space.
        The set <m>\{B(x,\varepsilon) : x\in X,\ \varepsilon>0\}</m> is a subbase for the induced topology on <m>X</m>.

  <p>
    If <m>B</m> is a subbase for a topology,
    then any open set in that topology is a union of finite intersections of subbase elements.
    One might wish for a better subbase with enough sets therein to ensure that every open set can be written as a union of elements of that subbase.
