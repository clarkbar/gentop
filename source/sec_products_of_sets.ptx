  <title>Products of sets</title>
  <p>
    An <term>indexed set</term> is really just another name for a map
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Remember that every element of every set is itself a set;
      thus the elements of <m>\Xi</m> are sets as well!
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    <m>U\colon A \to \Xi</m>;
    we typically abuse notation and write <m>U_a</m> instead of <m>U(a)</m>,
    and we write <m>(U_a)_{a\in A}</m> for the map <m>U</m>.
    The union of the indexed set
    <m>(U_a)_{a\in A}</m> will mean the union of the set <m>\{U_a : a\in A\}</m>:
    <me>
      \bigcup_{a\in A}U_a\coloneq\bigcup\{U_a : a\in A\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may seem a bit silly to belabour this point,
    but the purpose will, we hope, become clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    For any indexed set <m>(U_a)_{a\in A}</m>,
    the <term>product</term> is the set
    <me>
      \prod_{a\in A} U_a \coloneq \left\{x \in \Map\left(A,\bigcup_{a\in A}U_a\right) : (\forall a\in A)\ x(a)\in U_a\right\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An element of <m>\prod_{a \in A} U_a</m> is thus a map
    <m>x \colon A \to \bigcup_{a \in A} U_a</m> such that for every <m>a \in A</m>,
    one has <m>x(a) \in U_a</m>.
    One usually writes <m>x_a</m> instead of <m>x(a)</m>,
    and one often writes <m>x = (x_a)_{a\in A}</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        When <m>A = \{1,2\}</m>,
        an indexed set consists of two sets <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m>.
        The product <m>\prod_{a \in \{1,2\}} U_a</m> thus consists of pairs <m>(x_1, x_2)</m> with
        <m>x_1 \in U_1</m> and <m>x_2 \in U_2</m>.
        The assignment <m>(x_1,x_2) \mapsto \angs{x_1,x_2}</m> is a bijection <m>\prod_{a \in \{1,2\}} U_a \to U_1 \times U_2</m>.
        Most mathematicians are happy to pretend as if there is no difference between these sets;
        indeed, there is no <em>interesting</em> difference!
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    More generally, we think of the product
    <m>\prod_{a\in A} U_a</m> as the set of ordered
    <q><m>A</m>-tuples</q>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For every <m>b\in A</m>, there is an attached map
    <me>
      \pi_b \colon \prod_{a\in A}U_a \to U_b
    </me>
    given by the assignment <m>x \mapsto x_b</m>,
    called the <term>projection</term>
    onto the <m>b</m>-th factor.
  </p>
  <p>
    For every set <m>S</m>, every indexed set <m>\{U_a\}_{a\in A}</m>,
    and every indexed set <m>\left\{f_a\colon\fromto{S}{U_a}\right\}</m> of maps,
    there exists a unique map
    <me>
      f\colon S \to \prod_{a\in A}U_a
    </me>
    such that <m>\pi_a\circ f=f_a</m>.
    Indeed, the map <m>f</m> is given by the assignment <m>s \mapsto (f_a(s))_{a\in A}</m>.
